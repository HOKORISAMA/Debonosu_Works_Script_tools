Some tools to translate **Debnosu_works** or **Debo no Su Seisakusho** games.
Still have many bugs.

### HOW TO USE

**Usage**
1. Use Garbro to extract the game.pak file and from the script folder copy the scb files the any folder.
1. Put those /scb files in input_files folder and run main.py select `extract` mode that is `1`.
2. You'll get json files in json_files folder.
3. Write the translation in `trans` and run main.py again and select mode `replace` that is `2`.
4. You'll get new .scb file in output_files folder.

### Debonosu works game engine supports reading of file from folders so no need to repack files.


### Tested on Kagura Shinpuuki ～Mikuru no Shou～ / 神楽新風記～みくるの章～] and 	神楽凌艶譚～沙耶の章～/Kagura Ryouentan ~Saya no Shou ~.
